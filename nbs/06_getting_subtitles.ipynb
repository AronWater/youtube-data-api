       "'The President:  My fellow Americans, the federal government is charged  with the sacred duties of protecting our nation, supporting our Constitution, and defending our borders. We also have to ensure the equal application of our laws in all 50 states. Last year, politicians in California violated the Constitution by nullifying federal law and declaring their state to be a sanctuary from federal  immigration enforcement. A border-free zone thousands of criminal aliens can roam free, a very,  very dangerous situation. Unacceptable to everyone. Their actions not only imperil  the security of the people of California, but the security of the entire nation. California&#39;s sanctuary bill should be called &quot;The Jailbreak Bill,&quot; because that&#39;s exactly what it is. They force the release of dangerous criminal aliens from prisons and jails, including drug traffickers and dealers responsible for the deaths of countless Americans. It&#39;s gotten totally out of control. We can&#39;t allow it to go on. California&#39;s law also increases  our vulnerability to terrorism by keeping lifesaving information from federal authorities. The relationship is ridiculous. It forces law enforcement not to work together. Last week, the citizens of Orange County, California bravely resisted the open borders politicians in Sacramento. The range County Board of Supervisors courageously voted to join the administration&#39;s lawsuit to stop these dangerous and unconstitutional actions. All across California and all over America, everyday citizens are taking a stand to protect their families, protect their borders,  and protect their country. Every citizen has the right to be protected by federal law, and when politicians in California break those laws, they violate  the constitutional rights of their citizens. My message to communities under siege from drugs and gangs and violence is, &quot;You can stop this,  and you can stop it cold.&quot; Partner with the federal government so we can help to remove these threats from your communities and restore peace to our streets. I&#39;m also calling on Congress to immediately close the deadly border security loopholes that endanger our country. All over our country, we&#39;re living with laws that don&#39;t work. Congress has to change them. Democrats in Congress are doing everything in their power to undermine immigration enforcement and encourage illegal immigration. Their policies are putting all of America at risk. It is so bad, it&#39;s hard to believe what they&#39;re doing and why they&#39;re doing it. We can&#39;t let it continue. The Democrats are not doing  what&#39;s right for our country. I will not rest until we have secured our borders and restored the rule of law. We will win, and we will soon. It&#39;s happening.'"
